== About the mod
This mod is a result of my 1500+ hours in BG3, big part of which was played with friends in my party.

Vanilla Honor is too simple IMO (I got Honor achievement with first try, knowing almost nothing about DnD), and also I'm a little bit annoyed that some of my buddies overuse every cheesy mechanics they found and I have to wait when they use EVERY buff from camp :)

The goals of this mod:

- Make Honor mode slightly harder
- Eliminate as many abuses as possible
- Make too weak abilities stronger
- Make too strong abilities weaker
- Balance out need of resting for different classes

So this is an attempt to make the game ideal *for me*, so every change I made reflects my own impressions about game mechanics. +
I have no goal to make this mod suitable for everyone, but if you interested I would appreciate if you share your opinion in comments.

== Changelist

=== Exhaustion - new mechanics
A new mechanics which forces party to rest more often.
[%collapsible]
====
image::{screenshots-dir}/exhaustion_stacks.PNG[Exhaustion tooltip]

In a combat characters will get Exhaustion stacks, which on some point lead to various consequences:

- Level 1 (16+ stacks): slight fatigue. A penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks and spell
  DC
- Level 2 (24+ stacks): Uncontrollable sleep. Every turn character must perform CON saving throw or will fall asleep for
  2 turns
- Level 3 (40+ stacks): Death.

Long Rest (with supplies) removes all Exhaustion stacks, Short Rest twice a day (you cannot abuse Bard's rest) removes 10 + a halved character level (
rounded down). Potions of Angelic Reprieve/Slumber has no artificial limitations and always remove stacks.

Note: Not a direct adaptation of dnd5e Exhaustion and I'm not going to make a direct replica.
TBH I invented it in my head first and found that dnd already has something like that second.
====

=== Experience reward
Required XP per level increased.
[%collapsible]
====
Motivation:

- Do not let player to over-level enemies too much
- Bring more sense to XP rewards in Act III (in stock game player reaches level 12 at the beginning of Act III and
  progress stops)

Expected levels:

- 5 at the Act I before Rosymorn Monastery
- 6 at the end of Act I
- 8 at the end of Act II
- 12 at the end of Act III
====


=== Withers services: Respec, Resurrection and Hirelings
- Respec price is 1500 gold, but only 150 after Full Rest (while you stay in camp).
- Every origin character has one-time free respec button (via dependency mod https://mod.io/g/baldursgate3/m/free-one-time-respec-button-for-origins[Free one-time respec button for Origins] mod). I made this mainly to avoid exploiting of (almost free) resource regeneration after respec.
- Resurrection price is 500 gold.
- Hirelings does not have a free Revivify scroll anymore.

=== Pickpocketing
- You cannot pickpocket Volo and Jergal anymore
- You cannot endlessly pickpocket one person, you will get a Sleight of Hand debuff (resets on Long Rest)

Vanilla pickpocketing is too easy, and to pickpocket a camp members is nonsense.

=== Honor mode boost
- HP boost increased from +30% to range +100-200% (more for high level creatures)
- Honor attack roll bonus for high level enemies increased from 2 to 3
- HP for some bosses is increased manually

HP boost should give a chance for enemies to use their abilities and not being slain on first turn.

=== Multiclassing
Multiclassing is forbidden
[%collapsible]
====
First, it's impossible to balance out Multiclassing with my experience, knowledge and tools.
Second, I personally don't like it as a concept because it looks like an abusing combination of too strong low-level
features which are essential for pure class and could not be nerfed too much.
Proper multiclassing should include some lore limitations, karma mechanics of something else, which is not the case in
BG3.

BUT, if you do not care about my attempts to make things more balanced you can use my https://mod.io/g/baldursgate3/m/dedtuned-multiclass-enabler[DedTuned - Multiclass Enabler] mod.
====

=== Resting
- Long rest cost increased to 240.
- Partial Rest only resets cooldowns (except exploitable abilities and items) and restores 10% HP.

=== Buffs outside of party
Only your current party members can buff each other. No more buffs from camp hirelings.
[%collapsible]
====
All until-long-rest buffs now works only if Caster and Target are in one party.
Buff disappears if Caster and Target aren't in party simultaneously, but Caster always keeps its own buff on itself.

Weapon buffs disappear if caster left party and weapon is in party inventory.

Also fixed vanilla "feature" that such buffs remains after re-spec on any person except caster itself - now re-spec
removes them from everyone.
====

=== Feats
Feats do not provide Ability increase bonus anymore.
Instead, you have Ability +1 on level 7 and +2 on level 11.

I added new and changed some old feats to make different weapon build viable.
Duals and single-handed weapon builds are stronger than in vanilla.

==== Ability Improvement
- Removed from the game.

==== Abnormal Obstinacy - NEW FEAT
The number you need to roll a Critical Hit reduces by 1 every time you hit the same target in
melee. You should not use Two-Handed or Versatile weapon holding it in two hands. The effect
lasts until you roll Critical Hit or your turn ends. Stacks up to 5 times.

==== Ambidextrous - NEW FEAT
Once per turn after making an offhand melee attack can make an additional one for free.

==== Duelist Mage - NEW FEAT
You can cast a cantrip (except Eldritch Blast) as a bonus action after making a melee attack
with weapon you are proficient with. Your left hand should be free.

==== Tavern Brawler
- Does not add attack roll bonus

Note: it`s pretty strong damage boost for one feat, an attack roll bonus makes it imbalanced.

==== Great Weapon Master
- Attack roll penalty reduced to -3
- Damage bonus reduced to 6
- You can use additional attack only once per combat

Note: it is still strong damage boost, but not imbalanced.

==== Sharpshooter
- Attack roll penalty removed
- Works only for weapon in main hand
- Damage bonus is your DEX modifier
- Costs 4m of Movement for every shot

Note: now it's not a copy-paste of GWM, and cannot be abused with one-handed crossbows.

==== Durable
- Protects from critical hits

Note: critical hit mechanics forces you to use anti-crit equipment, but it is limited.
This feat is an option for those who wants to have extra protection and don't want to use anti-crit equipment.

=== Classes

==== Fighter Champion
- Improved Critical passive gives -2 critical threshold instead of -1

Note: this subclass is too weak comparing to Battle Master, so I bring him this buff.

==== Fighter Eldritch Knight
- War Magic passive now works on any spell, not only Cantrip


==== Barbarian
- Rage and End Rage does not consume Bonus Action
- Enraged Throw now gives stack of Frenzied Strain as Frenzied Strike always does.

Note: throwing build for Berserker was insanely strong, this change alongside of Tavern Brawler nerf should calm down it a little.

- War Priest Action Points reset on Short Rest instead of Long Rest
  Note: additional attack as bonus action isn't THAT strong.

=== Consumables

==== Potions
- Elixir of Hill Giant Strength now gives +2 STR up to 22
- Elixir of Cloud Giant Strength now gives +6 STR up to 26
- All healing potions take an Action for use and could not be thrown to an ally,
  but you can use it on ally in melee range

- Scroll of Battle Resurrection: a new scroll, very rare, price is 1000, could be used in combat

- Renamed to Arrow of Ricochet
- Now only affects one additional target in 9 meters range

==== Стрела из дымного пороха
- Damage changed to 3d4+9 Force + 1d4 Fire (now is identical to Smokepowder bomb)

==== Smokepowder Bomb and Fireworks
- Should be USED to make expected effect
- If thrown with "Throw" spell it just left smokepowder surface
- Uses the entire Action
- Added 1d4 fire damage
- Added 3m push effect (same as smokepowder arrow does)

=== Equipment

==== Enraging Heart Garb
Now works :)

- Applies no only to melee weapon attacks, but also to unarmed melee and melee spells as the description says

==== Hat of Fire Acuity, Hat of Storm Scion's Power, Helmet of Arcane Acuity, Gloves of Battlemage's Power
- Maximum Arcane Acuity stacks are limited to 4
- Gloves of Battlemage's Power now work exactly like Helmet of Arcane Acuity (give 2 stacks on weapon damage dealt). Original version do not work, and looks weak anyway.
